# Ion - A Community-Driven SFU

## What is Ion?

Ion began as the official Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) for the Pion WebRTC project. It quickly gathered an enthusiastic community but eventually grew too much that it had to move out of the Pion org: [Ion grown up and moving out](https://pion.ly/blog/ion-grown-up-and-moving-out/).

Maintenance slowed as core contributors moved on and the user base split between Pion and Ion. This repository aims to reboot the project and bring it back under Pion's active community.

## Why are we restarting Ion?

The Pion ecosystem lacks a fully-featured, community-maintained application that showcases and validates the core libraries. A healthy SFU implementation helps to:

* Surface bugs and missing features in Pion itself.
* Provide a reference architecture for developers building on top of Pion.
* Strengthen the open-source WebRTC and Go landscape.

## Project Goals

1. Deliver an SFU with feature-parity to modern commercial offerings.
   * For example: First-class support for SVC, simulcast, and multicasting a single stream to multiple rooms from a single source (Maybe we should look for a better term for this feature).
2. Be cloud-native by design.
   * Simple, horizontally-scalable architecture.
   * Multiple SFU instances can serve the same room concurrently.
3. Offer a modern, layered API.
   * High-level plugin/extension API that hides WebRTC details.
   * Low-level API for advanced use-cases, users should be able to re-implement the same features in the high-level API and provide their own interfaces, This should be abstracted away from non power users.
4. Provide a clean, typed Web SDK.
5. Ship a reference web application with a modern UI.
6. Create an SDK for low-power platforms (like: embedded/IoT devices and single-board computers) by compiling Pion with TinyGo. This first requires finishing TinyGo support in Pion; minimum hardware specs and potential hardware acceleration will be assessed later.
7. Include WHIP support from day one, WHEP support will be evaluated during stage one.
8. Why ship an SDK instead of client?
Because many applications need programmable access to the SFU, not just a "play/pause" client. An SDK lets developers embed, extend, and automate SFU specific features from their own code-base.

What the SDK should let you do:
1. Control permissions & scopes, issue, refresh, and introspect tokens for every room, user, or stream.
2. Stream and control, list the streams a user may see, selectively subscribe/forward, and throttle or terminate feeds.
3. Room control, admit or kick participants, split/merge rooms, and keep shared room state in sync.
4. Flexible publishing, push one or many streams (main, screen-share, data) with lifecycle hooks for pause, resume, renegotiation, and restart.
5. Event subscription, consume real-time callbacks (join/leave, quality change, network loss, errors).
6. User management, create, update, or delete users and API keys.
7. Transcoding & simulcast hooks, trigger layer filtering, down-mixing, or server-side re-encoding.


## Pain Points with the Current Pion-Based Stack

1. RTX/FEC handling is opaque. An SFU cannot easily strip, regenerate, or adapt redundancy streams; especially in multi-rendition or SVC scenarios.
2. Because transport state is currently locked inside in-memory objects (UDP, DTLS, SRTP, SCTP, etc.), streams can't be migrated cleanly between SFU instances. DTLS state will remain excluded for security, and true migration will depend on completing DTLS-restart; which should be even easier with DTLS 1.3.
3. Limited support for modern codecs features.
4. Incomplete statistics and congestion-control APIs.
5. Security hardening (DTLS/SRTP cipher suites, DTLS 1.3, rate limiting, quota management) is missing.
6. Monitoring and observability hooks (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, tracing) are hard to implement, because many API and states are private.

We welcome issues, discussions, and pull requests. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidelines (coming soon).

## Stage 0 - Next Steps

The project is currently in **Stage 0: Discovery & Design**. Our immediate focus is to build consensus on the initial architecture and governance model.

1. **Gather feedback** - Open GitHub issues or start a Discussion in the [discord](https://discord.gg/PngbdqpFbt) to share pain points, feature requests, and use-cases in the #ion channel.
2. **Draft design proposals (RFCs)** - Contributors submit markdown documents in describing architecture ideas, APIs, and migration strategies.
3. **Community voting** - RFCs will be discussed on Discord and in GitHub Discussions. We will use üëç/üëé reactions to measure support and move proposals forward.
4. **Define the MVP** - Based on accepted RFCs, we will lock a minimal feature set for the first public milestone.
5. **Decide on the name** - We will decide on the name of the project, if we'll keep the name "Ion" and pick a new major version or pick a new name to avoid confusion with the original Ion project.

Our goal is to complete Stage 0 hopefully under **4 weeks** and transition into implementation (Stage 1).

Feel free to make commits / PRs to update this README.md.
